## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an aspiring Rimworld Modder!
I'm currently working on developing a Centaur mod for Rimworld 1.5!
I'm currently learning how to read and use XML
I'm looking for advice/tutorials on how to mod for 1.5 as everything I've found online is outdated -__-
You can reach me at specksjunkmail@gmail.com -- despite the name I do check it XD
